```{r}
companies <- c("JNJ", "PG", "UL")
prices <- read_stock_prices(companies, what = "daily", start_year = 2000, end_year = 2015)

```
```{r}
ggplot(prices,aes(x = date, y = close)) + geom_line(aes(colour=company))

```
```{r}
Actions <- data.frame (action = c("buy", "sell"),
        date = ymd(c("2006-01-03", "2014-12-30")))
                       
Actions_x <- Actions %>% left_join(prices) %>% select(company,close,action) %>% spread(key=action,value=close)

Actions_y <- Actions_x %>% mutate(profit =  sell - buy)%>% mutate(percent = (sell - buy)/buy *100)%>% select(company, profit, percent)  


```


Question: In the graph the year 2005 is the base year


```{r}
ref_date <- ymd("2005-01-03")
reference <- prices %>% filter(date == ref_date) %>% select(company, standard = close)

reference_y <- prices %>% left_join(reference) %>% mutate(index = close/standard)
```

```{r}
dividends <- read_stock_prices(companies, what = "dividends")

dividends_y <- dividends %>% left_join(prices)


```
