Mao Zedong was the founder of the Community Party of China and the People's Republic of China. He originally was a peasant farmer who joined the Revolution Army and took down the Qing Dynasty. 

After the Chinese Civil War, Mao declared China a communist state. His victory is not well-liked because he made his people march across China for 7,000 miles. The Long March killed many communists.
