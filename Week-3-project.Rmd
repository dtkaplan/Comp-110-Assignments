Figure 1:

Scatter plot; sector, wage, experience, marital status; wage and experience are the frame, sector is the facet, and marital status is the glyph

Figure 2: 

Density plot; bmi, sex, pregnancy; bmi is the frame, pregnancy is the facet, and sex is mapped to the glyph

In figure 2 there is no y variable because density takes the place of a y variable in the frame. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
View(CPS85)
View(NCHS)
```

```{r}
ggplot(CPS85, aes(x=exper, y=wage, color=married)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~sector)
```

```{r}
ggplot(NCHS, aes(x=bmi)) + geom_density(aes(color= sex)) + facet_wrap(~pregnant)
```
