figure 1 is a scatterplot, the second is a density plot

the first has married, wage, exper, and sector; the second has bmi, density, sex, and pregnant

each variable serves as an aesthetic and/or scale

density describes data frequency

ggplot(data = CPS85, aes(x = exper, y = wage, color = married)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap( ~ sector)
ggplot(data = NCHS, aes(x = bmi)) + geom_density(aes(color = sex)) + facet_wrap(~ pregnant)

diamonds %>%
  group_by(color) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(carat)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average)) %>%
  head(1)

diamonds %>%
  group_by(clarity) %>%
  summarise(average = mean(table/carat)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average)) %>%
  head(1)

There are 80,101 cases.
