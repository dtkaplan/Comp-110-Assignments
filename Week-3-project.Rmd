1. Scatter plot for figure 1, and density plot for figure 2
2. Figure 1 involves sector, marriage status, and wages. Figure 2's variables are sex: male and female. 
3. Aesthetics, indicating the meaning of a data point.
4. There is no data variable being used for the y-axis because we are plotting density, which is a new point of data produced from transforming the existing data.

**R statements that generate Figure 1:** 
ggplot(data=CPS85, aes(x=exper, y=wage, color=married))+geom_point() + facet_wrap( ~ sector)

**R statesments that generate Figure 2:**
ggplot(data=NCHS, aes(x=bmi))+ geom_density(aes(color = sex)) + facet_wrap( ~ pregnant)

1. diamonds %>% group_by(color) %>% summarise(average=mean(carat)) %>% arrange(desc(average)) %>% head() 

The largest diamonds are typically color J.

2. Largest diamond "table" per carat: VVS1

diamonds %>% group_by(clarity) %>% summarise(average=mean(table/carat)) %>% arrange(desc(average)) %>% head()

**Voting**

1. 80101 cases
2. *second choice:* Betsy Hodges, Don Samuels, Mark Andrew, Jackie Cherryhomes, and Bob Fine
3. First choice: 834
Second choice: 10598
Third choice: 19210

Minneapolis2013 %>% group_by(Third) %>% filter(Third == "undervote") %>% group_by(Second) %>% tally(sort=TRUE)

4. Top 3 Second vote selections: Mark Andrew, Don Samuels, Jackie Cherryhomes

Minneapolis2013 %>% group_by(First) %>% filter(First == "BETSY HODGES") %>% group_by(Second) %>% tally(sort=TRUE)

5. The highest fraction of first vote selections marked as undervote: 0.077 

Minneapolis2013 %>% group_by(Precinct) %>% summarise(highest = mean(First == "undervote")) %>% arrange(desc(highest))
