the first is a scatterplot, the second is a density plot

the first has married, wage, exper, and sector; the second has bmi, density, sex, pregnant

each variable serves as an aesthetic and or scale

density describes frequency

ggplot(data = CPS85, aes(x = exper, y = wage, color = married)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap( ~ sector)
ggplot(data = NCHS, aes(x = bmi)) + geom_density(aes(color = sex)) + facet_wrap(~ pregnant)
