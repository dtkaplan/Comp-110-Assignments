##17.1 

There are several variables in the model.The explanatory ones are fireplace, bedrooms, bathroom and living area.

##17.2 

For living areas below 1080 square feet, the number of bathrooms does not not influence prices.

##17.3

For a house with living area between 1080 and 1483, the difference in prices depending on size can be calculated as:

```{r}
179796.647 - 151424.497
```
The answer is thus $28372.15.


##17.4 
Having a fireplace for house larger than 2816 square feet, more than one fire place does result in a higher price compared to having just one or no fireplace. This however, might primarily be due to the fact because these houses have very large living areas.
