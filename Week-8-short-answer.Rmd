##Question 7.2

1. The variables fireplaces, bedrooms, living_area, and bathrooms, and (indirectly at least) price are in the model.

2. For houses with a living area less than 1080 square feet, the number of bathrooms doesn't make a difference in price. 

3. For houses with a livin area between 1080 and 1483 square feet, the typical difference in price between houses with 1.5 bathrooms and houses with two bathrooms is 28372.15 (179796.647 - 151424.497).

4. Having a fireplace is typically associated with a higher house price, but that's due in part to the fact that houses with fireplaces also tend to have larger living areas.
