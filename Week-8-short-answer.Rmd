# Question 17.2

```{r}
Houses <-
read.file("http://tiny.cc/dcf/houses-for-sale.csv")
house_model <-party::ctree(price ~  living_area + bathrooms + bedrooms + fireplaces, data = Houses)
plot(house_model, type = "simple")
```

Note: The graph is not readable, I don't know why, so I read Qiuhan's graph to do the question but the code above just demonstrate I know how to do that...
 
1. 1. Price is the response variable. The explanatory variables are living area, bathrooms, bedrooms and fireplaces.

2. No. Because the bathroom number does not enter the model at that step.

3. The typical differences are:
```{r}
180000 - 151000
```

4. I found out that the fireplace added into those houses researched (which are houses have 2816 sq ft of area) have very different prices.
