```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- "http://tiny.cc/dcf/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data-Small.rds"
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Trips, aes(x= sdate)) + geom_density()
```

```{r}
Trips <- Trips %>% mutate(time_of_day = lubridate::hour(sdate) + lubridate::minute(sdate)/60) 
ggplot(Trips, aes(x= time_of_day)) + geom_density()
```

```{r}
Trips <- Trips %>% mutate(day_of_week = lubridate::wday(sdate))
ggplot(Trips, aes(x= day_of_week)) + geom_density() + facet_wrap(~day_of_week)
```

```{r}
ggplot(Trips, aes(x= day_of_week, fill=client)) + geom_density(color="NA", alpha=0.4) + facet_wrap(~day_of_week)
```

```{r}
ggplot(Trips, aes(x= , fill=client)) + geom_density(position= position_stack(), color="NA", alpha=0.4) + facet_wrap(~day_of_week)
```

I think that for this particular graphic, it is more helpful to have the plots overlayed to be able to compare heights. Having them stacked makes them easier to distinguish but harder to compare. 

```{r}
Trips <- Trips %>% mutate(wday=ifelse(lubridate::wday(sdate) %in% c(1,7), "weekend", "weekday"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(Trips, aes(x= time_of_day, fill= client)) +geom_density()
