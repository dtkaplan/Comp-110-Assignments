```{r}
Birthdays %>%
  mutate(week = lubridate::week(date)) %>%

Birthdays %>%
  mutate(yday = lubridate::yday(date)) %>%

Births in year 1986, 1987:
```{r}
MyTwoYears <- Birthdays %>%

  group_by(date, wday) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births))

ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(date, total, colour=wday)) + geom_line()
```

Holidays <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/dcf/US-Holidays.csv") %>% mutate(date = as.POSIXct(lubridate::dmy(date)))
```

```{r}
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(date, total, colour=wday)) + geom_line() + geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(Holidays$date), colour="blue") + geom_text(data=Holidays,aes(label=holiday, x=as.numeric(date), y=10000))
```
