Births by date
```{r}
data("Birthdays", package = "mosaicData")

Birthdays %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = total)) + geom_point()
```

Births by week of year
```{r}
Birthdays %>%
  mutate(week = lubridate::week(date)) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(week, total)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

Births by month
```{r}
Birthdays %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(date)) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(month, total)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

```

Births by Julian date
```{r}
Birthdays %>%
  mutate(yday = lubridate::yday(date)) %>%
  group_by(yday) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(yday, total)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

Births by day of the week
```{r}
Birthdays %>%
  mutate(wday = lubridate::wday(date, label = T)) %>%
  group_by(wday) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(wday, total)) + geom_point()
```

Births in year 1986, 1987:
```{r}
MyTwoYears <- Birthdays %>%
  filter(year == 1986 | year == 1987) %>%
  mutate(wday = lubridate::wday(date, label=T)) %>%
  group_by(date, wday) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(births))

ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(date, total, colour=wday)) + geom_line()
```

List of Holidays:
```{r}
Holidays <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/dcf/US-Holidays.csv") %>% mutate(date = as.POSIXct(lubridate::dmy(date)))
```

```{r}
Small_Holidays <- Holidays %>% filter(year == 1986 | year == 1987)

ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(date, total)) + geom_line(aes(colour=wday)) + geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(Holidays$date)) + geom_text(data=Small_Holidays,aes(label=holiday, x=date), y=10000, angle=45)
```

Make a less busy plot
Create variable is_holiday
```{r}
MyTwoYears <- MyTwoYears %>%
  mutate(is_holiday = date %in% Holidays$date)
```

Make plots
```{r}
ggplot(MyTwoYears, aes(date, total)) + geom_smooth(aes(colour=is_holiday), se=F) + geom_point(aes(colour=is_holiday, alpha=1/10, size=is_holiday)) 
```
