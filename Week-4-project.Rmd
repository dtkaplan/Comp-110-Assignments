```{r}
MyTwoYears <- Birthdays%>%
  filter(year(date)%in% 1985:1986) %>%
  group_by(date)%>%
  summarise(births=sum(births))

MyTwoYears%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y=births))+geom_point()
  
```
It can be seen that there are two seperate trends for the graph obtained. We can see that both waves mirror each other. However some dates have lower births, and other dates have higher births. Both the dates with relatively low births and the dates with relatively high births follow the same pattern.

  filter(year(date)%in% c(1985:1986))

ggplot(MyTwoYears,aes(x = date, y = births))+geom_line(aes(color = wday))+geom_vline(data = Holidays,aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date)))
```
