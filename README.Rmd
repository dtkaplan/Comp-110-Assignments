# Comp-110-Assignments

Storage for the assignments done in COMP 110

Each student will have an individual branch in this repository, named according to the student's Macalester email ID, e.g. `bobama`.

Here are the steps to set things up:

1. Direct your browser to <https://github.com/dtkaplan/Comp-110-Assignments>
2. Click the green "Clone or download" button, then press the small clipboard icon. You should see a word balloon "Copied!". This will copy the address of the GitHub repository
3. Now go to your RStudio system. This might be the Macalester server <rstudio.macalester.edu> or it might be an RStudio system that you have installed on your own computer.
4. In RStudio, select the FILE/New Project menu item. In the resulting dialog box:
    - select "Version Control" then
    - select "Git"
5. In the dialog box that is shown, paste the address that you copied in step (2). If you are on your own computer, you may want to press the "Browse ..." button to place the respository in a directory that you think is appropriate. If you do not know what this might mean, accept the default.
6. Press the "Create Project" button. You will see some messages about cloning the project and then RStudio will restart. When this is finished, the upper right corner of the RStudio window will display the project name: Comp-110-Assignments.

Look around the project to orient yourself. **DO NOT EDIT** any file, yet. Soon, we'll create a "branch" of the repository for your personal use.

Check out the Files tab in RStudio. This lists the files that already exist in the project. There are two series of files:

1. `Week_#_short_answers.Rmd` where # is a one-digit number.
2. `Week_#_project.Rmd`

These are where you will put your work, per the [course schedule](dtkaplan.github.io/comp110).

## Customizing the repository for your individual use.

You are now going to create a "branch" of the repository for your own personal use. **All** your work will be done in this branch.  

1. Go to the "Git" tab in RStudio. You will see a label "master" on the far right of the toolbar for that tab. That means you are currently in the "master" branch of the project. We will **never** edit a file in the master branch. In the following steps, you are going to create a new branch, just for you.
2. Now go to the "Console." Cut and paste these commands at the console prompt **making sure to replace** `bobama` with your own Macalester email id.
```{r eval = FALSE}
system("git checkout -b bobama") # replace bobama!
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
system("git push -u origin bobama") # Here, too, replace bobama!
```
3. Look in the "Git" tab again. You should see "master" replaced by the branch you just created. If that branch is named `bobama`, hang your head with shame and embarrassment and go back and give the two `system()` commands again, but this time with your own email ID instead of the President's.

Now you are ready to start editing the files in your branch.

Whenever you start up RStudio, make sure that you are in the `Comp-110-Assignments` project (look in the upper right corner of the RStudio window) and that the "Git" tab is displaying your personal branch. Almost always, this will happen automatically, but sometimes things go wrong due to a system crash.
