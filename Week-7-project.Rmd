Here is my content!

```{r}
Wake_County <- read.csv("http://tiny.cc/dcf/street-addresses.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

download.file(url = "http://tiny.cc/dcf/CMS_ProvidersSimple.rds", destfile = "Medicare.rds")

##Could not open Medicare data therefore will continue with only WakeCounty data
Medicare <- readRDS("Medicare.rds")

```

```{r}
Wake_County %>%
  filter(grepl("ST|RD|ROAD",address)) %>%
  head()

pattern <- "ST| RD|ROAD"
LeftOvers <-
  Wake_County %>%
  filter(!grepl(pattern,address),  #This takes out all addresses that included ST, RD, and ROAD
         !grepl(" BOX ",address),   #This takes out everything that has "Box"
         !grepl(" CIRCLE| TRAIL| AVE",address),
         !grepl(" WAY| LN| DR",address),
         !grepl(" CT| CIR",address),
         !grepl(" LANE| COURT| PL| BLVD| POINT| PATH| PKWY| HALL| HWY| NCSU| LOOP| TERRACE| BOULEVARD",address))  

LeftOvers

##My Turn

```{r}

Wake_County %>%
  tidyr::extract(address,into = "street_word",
                 regex = pattern_1,
                 remove = FALSE) %>%
