LeftOvers <-
    Wake_county %>%
        filter(!grepl(road_related, address), !grepl(" BOX ", address)) #Here the filter removes all rows that contain in their address one of the element in the regex road_related and " BOX "
```

```{r }
regexMatch <-
Wake_county %>%
   filter(!grepl("BOX ", address)) %>% #filtering out addresses of PO boxes
  tidyr::extract(address, into = "street_word", regex = road_related, remove = FALSE) %>% select(street_word) %>% #I just want the street_word column
  group_by(street_word) %>% #I want to group by the possible road related words in street_word
  tally() #to count the occurance of each word.
```


## In class
grepl(regexPattern, String) to match regex
Here is my content!

```{r include = FALSE}
pattern <-"(z|q).*z" #"z.{3}z" "z.+z" #.* = anything you got
Name_count <-
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(grepl(pattern, name)) %>%
  head()
pattern2 <- "[aeiou]*[aeiou].*[aeiou]" #names with \ least 3 vowels
pattern3 <- "[^aeiou]*[aeiou][^aeiou]+[aeiou][^aeiou]+[aeiou]" #names with exactly 3 vowels
```
