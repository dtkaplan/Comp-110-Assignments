I downloaded my content from URL "http://tiny.cc/dcf/Library-small.rda",dest="Library-small.rda"

Basics
```{r}
load("Library-small.rda")
nrow(Inv)
names(Inv)
nrow(Bks)
names(Bks)
```
Both Inv and Bks are not very big datasets (<4000 rows),w  with <20 dimensions/variables.

```{r}
Inv %>% group_by(Current.Status) %>% tally()
Inv %>% group_by(Issued.Count) %>% tally()
```
Most cases in Inv were shown to be "Available" in the Current.Status variable. Most issued counts are 0.
