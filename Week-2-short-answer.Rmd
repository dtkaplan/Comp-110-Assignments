Problem 1.2
In the 'president' column, the names do not follow the same pattern. Lincoln, Abraham has the format: last, first, in contrast to George Washington which follows the format: first, last.

Similarly, the values for the 'in office' column, the formatting for year ranges is inconsistent. 1791-1799 and 1837-1841 are different formats.

Further in the 'number of states' column categorical and quantitative values are mixed. 'it depends' and '16' should not be part of the same column.

Problem 2.4:*
help(NHANES, package <- "NHANES")
I am unsure on this one. 
Perhaps it is poor form to assign the package inside the function, although after testing this doesn't seem to be the likely reason.
When I tested this function it worked fine.View

4. sum(variable)

Problem 3.2:
Chaining together a statement that is already non-chaining syntax is improper.
Babynames %>%...

would be fine. But not together.

Problem 3.3:
